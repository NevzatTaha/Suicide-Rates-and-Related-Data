# Suicide-Rates-and-Related-Data
 Hello, I want to try to find statistical meaning in data sets. Data sets include three different data frames, which they do not match each other in terms of unique keys. Firstly, I have visualized sexes in terms of suicide rates, and Male has a higher statistical average, so I used male as sex for some parts of my project. Also, I have found statistical differences between sexes to support visualization in which suicide rates increase when ages go up, and there is a strong correlation, 0.889. Then, I observed facilities, and I wondered whether there is a statistical relation between mental hospitals and mental health day treatment facilities because these are the specific facilities for our subject, but others, such as health units, can be facilities because they have to be built for some compulsory rules. To clarify this idea, when hospitals are built, it has to contain mental units as a rule. As a result, I could not find any statistical correlation. In the last part, I try to find whether there is a similarity between countries where health units and mental hospitals have a higher value than the mean and suicide rates are higher than the mean in 2016, but there is no similar country for the two lists.
