# Suicide-Rates-and-Related-Data
 Hello, I want to try to find statistical meaning in a data sets. Data sets include three different dataframe which they do not match each other in terms of unique keys. 
 Firstly, I  have visualized sexes in terms of suicide rates, and Male has a higher stastical average, so I used male as a sex for the some parts of my project. Also, I have found there is a stastical differences between sexes to support visualization which suicide rates go up, when ages go up, and there is strong correlation, 0.889. Then, I have observed facilities, and I wonder whether there is a statistical relation between mental hospitals and mental health day treatment facilities because these arethe specisific facilities for the our subject, but others, such as health units can be facilities because they have to be built for some compulsory rules. To clarify this idea, when hospital are built, it has to contain mental units as a rule. As a result, I could not find any stastical correlaltion. In the last part, I try to find whether there is a similarity between countries where health units and mental hospitals have a higher value than mean and suicide rates which are higher than mean in 2016, but there is no similar country for the two list.
